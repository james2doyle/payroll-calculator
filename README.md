Payroll Calculator
==================

A simple applescript app to calculate the amount of payroll deductions for a business to pay.

This assumes each employee is being paid the same.

**I made this because we kept forgetting the calculation for the business to pay the payroll deductions**

### Running

When you first run the app, it tells you that it is not a verified app and that it was downloaded from the web. That's fine. It just means you got it from a website and not through the AppStore.

If you are still having issues running it. Right click on the app and choose "Open" from the menu. This is like saying, *"Just open this B already and I know what I am doing."*

### Steps

* Get the CPP deductions the employee made
* Get the total deductions made
* Enter the number of employees
* Show the total
* Copy the end total to the clipboard. Allow opening the CRA site to pay the deduction

### Compiling to a .app file.

* [Download this file](https://github.com/james2doyle/payroll-calculator/archive/master.zip)
* Open it with the AppleScript Editor (should be default)
* Go to File > Export...
* Choose a location for the .app file to live (I suggest the Applications folder)
* Choose "Application" as the File Format
* Click Save

Now you can double click the app and run it.
